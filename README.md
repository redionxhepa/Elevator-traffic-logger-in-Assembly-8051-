# Elevator-traffic-logger-in-Assembly-8051-

This is a really demanding project done in cooperation with Arash Asheafnejad.The main idea of this project is to detect the stopping floor of the elevator and store this data in an SD-card.In order to detect the exact floor a really precise barometer and RTC module were needed to be sampled.All the components were embedded in a single breadboard and making this project really portable.The result(need for debugging purpouses) of the floor was shown even in a seven-segment display.In this way the passengers in the elevator could check for any inconsistency in our device.At the end data was send by a wireless module and stored in an SD-card module.There we could check all the routine of the elevator.This was meant to be the first stage of a major project involving machine learning algorithms by my group mate.Arduino and Atmel 8051 were the main microcontrollers used.
